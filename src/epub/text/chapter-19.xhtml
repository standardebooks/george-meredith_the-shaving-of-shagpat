			<h2 epub:type="title">The Revival</h2>
			<p>Now, the feathers of Koorookh in his flight were ruffled by a chill breeze, and they were speeding through a light glow of cold rose-colour. Then said Noorna, “ ’Tis the messenger of morning, the blush. Oh, what changes will date from this day!”</p>
			<p>The glow of rose became golden, and they beheld underneath them, on one side, the rim of the rising red sun, and rays streaming over the Earth and its waters. And Noorna said, “I must warn Feshnavat, my father, and prepare him for our coming.”</p>
			<p>So she plucked a feather from Koorookh and laid the quill downward, letting it drop. Then said she, “Now for the awakening of my betrothed!”</p>
			<p>Thereupon she hugged his head a moment, and kissed him on the eyelids, the cheeks, and the lips, crying, “By this means only!” Crying that, she pushed him, sliding, from the back of the bird, and he parted from them, falling headforemost in the air like a stricken eagle. Then she called to Koorookh, “Seize him!” and the bird slanted his beak and closed his wings, the two, Abarak and Noorna, clinging to him tightly; and he was down like an arrow between Shibli Bagarag and the ground, spreading beneath him like a tent, and Noorna caught the youth gently to her lap; then she pushed him off again, intercepting his descent once more, till they were on a level with one of the mountains of the Earth, from which the City of Shagpat is visible among the yellow sands like a white spot in the yolk of an egg. So by this time the eyes of the youth gave symptoms of a desire to look upon the things that be, peeping faintly beneath the lashes, and she exclaimed joyfully, raising her white hands above her head, “One plunge in the lake, and life will be his again!”</p>
			<p>Below them was a green lake, tinted by the dawn with crimson and yellow, deep, and with high banks. As they crossed it to the middle, she slipped off the youth from Koorookh, and he with a great plunge was received into the stillness of the lake. Meanwhile Koorookh quivered his wings and seized him when he arose, bearing him to an end of the lake, where stood one dressed like a Dervish, and it was the Vizier Feshnavat, the father of Noorna. So when he saw them, he shouted the shout of congratulation, catching Noorna to his breast, and Shibli Bagarag stretched as doth a heavy sleeper in his last doze, saying, in a yawning voice, “What trouble? I wot there is nought more for us now that Shagpat is shaved! Oh, I have had a dream, a dream! He that is among Houris in Paradise dreameth not a dream like that. And I dreamed⁠—’tis gone!”</p>
			<p>Then said he, staring at them, “Who be ye? What is this?”</p>
			<p>Noorna, took him again to her bosom, and held him there; and she plucked a herb, and squeezed it till a drop from it fell on either of his lids, applying to them likewise a dew from the serpents of the Sword, and he awoke to the reality of things. Surely, then he prostrated himself and repeated the articles of his faith, taking one hand of his betrothed and kissing her; and he embraced Abarak and Feshnavat, saying to the father of Noorna, “I know, O Feshnavat, that by my folly and through my weakness I have lost time in this undertaking, but it shall be short work now with Shagpat. This thy daughter, the Eclipser of Reason, was ever such a prize as she? I will deserve her. <i xml:lang="ar-Latn">Wullahy!</i> I am now a new man, sprung like fire from ashes. Lo, I am revived by her for the great work.”</p>
			<p>Said Abarak: “O Master of the Event, secure now without delay the two slaves of the Sword, and lean the blade toward Aklis.”</p>
			<p>Upon that, he ran up rapidly to the summit of the mountain and drew the Sword from his girdle, and leaned it toward Aklis, and it lengthened out over lands, the blade of it a beam of solid brilliance. Presently, from forth the invisible remoteness they saw the two genii, Karavejis and Veejravoosh, and they were footing the blade swiftly, like stars, speeding up till they were within reach of the serpents of the hilt, when they dropped to the earth, bowing their heads; so he commanded them to rise, crying, “Search ye the Earth and its confines, and bring hither tidings of the genie Karaz.”</p>
			<p>They said, “To hear is to obey.”</p>
			<p>Then they began to circle each round the other, circling more and more sharply till beyond the stretch of sight, and Shibli Bagarag said to Feshnavat, “Am I not awake, O Feshnavat? I will know where is Karaz ere I seek to operate on Shagpat, for it is well spoken of the poet:</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
				<p>
					<span>“ ‘Obstructions first remove</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere thou thy cunning prove’;</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="continued">“and I will encounter this Karaz that was our ass, ere I try the great shave.”</p>
			<p>Then said he, turning quickly, “Yonder is the light from Aklis striking on the city, and I mark Shagpat, even he, illumined by it, singled out, where he sitteth on the roof of the palace by the marketplace.”</p>
			<p>So they looked, and it was as he had spoken, that Shagpat was singled out in the midst of the city by the wondrous beams of the eye of Aklis, and made prominent in effulgence.</p>
			<p>Said Abarak, climbing to the level of observation, “He hath a redness like the inside of a halved pomegranate.”</p>
			<p>Feshnavat stroked his chin, exclaiming, “He may be likened to a mountain goat in the midst of a forest roaring with conflagration.”</p>
			<p>Said Shibli Bagarag, “Now is he the red-maned lion, the bristling boar, the uncombed buffalo, the plumaged cock, but soon will he be like nothing else save the wrinkled kernel of a shaggy fruit. Lo, now, the Sword! it leapeth to be at him, and ’twill be as the keen icicle of winter to that perishing foliage, that doomed crop! So doth the destined minute destroy with a flash the hoarded arrogance of ages; and the destined hand doeth what creation failed to perform; and ’tis by order, destiny, and preordainment, that the works of this world come to pass. This know I, and I witness thereto that am of a surety ordained to the Shaving of Shagpat!”</p>
			<p>Then he stood apart and gazed from Shagpat to the city that now began to move with the morning; elephants and coursers saddled by the gates of the King’s palace were visible, and camels blocking the narrow streets, and the markets bustling. Surely, though the sun illumined that city, it was as a darkness behind Shagpat singled by the beams of Aklis.</p>
